# Connectivities in Brain Network Activities
 Brain networks are invariably complex, share several common features with networks from other biological and physical systems, and may hence be characterized using complex systems methods. 

 The purpose of this project is to use dynamic modes decomposition(DMD) which is a powerful data-driven modeling method to construct the modes of brain activities during resting-state or task fMRI structure.
 
 ## Background
 I am Niloufar, a second-year M.Sc student in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran, with a major in Computational Sciences and Algorithms. For my master thesis, I have focused on complex systems and  I am using dynamic mode decomposition on fMRI time series using open source databases like HCP. I chose a Computational Science major to develop stronger mathematical skills to deal with complex topics. 

In the past three years, I have focused on Data Science and Machine learning and worked on projects either with my advisor or during my internships which have helped me gain working experience in data collecting, data-driven modeling and analyzing to find appropriate patterns to help to make decisions on the different type of data sets, like signals, time-series images, clicking behaviors from online education platforms to music platform.
