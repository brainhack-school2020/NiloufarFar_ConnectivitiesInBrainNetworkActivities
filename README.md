 Brain networks are invariably complex, share several common features with networks from other biological and physical systems, and may hence be characterized using complex systems methods. 

 The purpose of this project is to use dynamic modes decomposition(DMD) which is a powerful data-driven modeling method to construct the modes of brain activities during resting-state or task fMRI structure.
